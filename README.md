# Airline Management API

## Overview

The Airline Management API is a backend application designed to manage airplanes, flights, and passenger reservations for an airline company. Built using Spring Boot, it provides a set of RESTful APIs to handle operations such as flight scheduling, airplane assignment, and passenger bookings. The system ensures efficient management by incorporating robust validation, exception handling, and email notifications.

## Features

- **Airplane Management:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete airplane data.
- **Flight Management:** Manage flights and their association with airplanes.
- **Reservation System:** Book and manage passenger reservations.
- **Cascade Effect:**
  - An airplane can be used for multiple flights, and each flight is assigned to an airplane.
  - A flight can have multiple reservations, and each reservation is linked to a flight.
- **Email Notifications:**
  - Notifications are sent when a reservation is made, flight details change, or a user's email address is updated.  
  - @Async is used for non-blocking email notifications.
  - JavaMailSender and Thymeleaf are used for HTML email templates.

- **Global Exception Handling:** Ensures proper error management with meaningful error messages.    

- **Filtering & Booking:**
  - Users can filter flights by departure location, arrival location, departure date, and arrival date.  
  - @JsonIgnore is used in entity relationships to avoid infinite loops during serialization. Without it, filtering would cause an infinite loop.
  - The system verifies the capacity of the flight before booking.
- **Airplane Availability Check:** Ensures an airplane is available before assigning it to a flight.
- **Unique Reservation Code:**
  - Each reservation has a unique code that remains unchanged even if the flight or email is updated.
- **PATCH Method Handling:**
  - `@RequestPart` with `MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_VALUE` is used for PATCH methods, requiring parameters as strings. These values are parsed in the service layer.
- **Seeding Data:**
  - Sample data is provided, including test cases for various failure scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java
- **Frontend (for Email Templates):** Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS
- **Database:** H2 (In-memory)
- **ORM:** JPA & Hibernate
- **Email Notifications:** Java Mail API
- **Security:** Spring Security (all endpoints permitted)
- **Documentation:** Swagger

## Error Handling

The application includes global exception handling to return meaningful error messages. Some custom exceptions include:

- **AirplaneNotAvailableException:** Triggered when an airplane is unavailable.
- **FlightFullyBookedException:** Raised when a flight reaches full capacity.
- **ReservationAlreadyExistsException:** Raised if a duplicate reservation is attempted.
- **InvalidFlightTimeException:** Thrown if the departure time is after the arrival time.
